Welcome!
This is a repository with some assignements and projects in a few of my applied computer science degree at Université de Montréal.

Each branch represents a different course, containing mostly 3 different delivery each.
All of my projects were done alone for every course, except the System Administration course (IFT 3830), teams of 2.

I graduated from this program in August 2024 with a gpa of 4.06/4.30.
